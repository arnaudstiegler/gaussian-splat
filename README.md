Reproducing Gaussian Splatting


# TODO:
- Introduce a class for one gaussian splat
- Download some data with SFM info
    - Not sure what to do with the current binary format, which is super cumbersome, and can't be pickled without code changes
    - Ultimately, only need one scene to test things out
- get the data ingestion pipeline up
