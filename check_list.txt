# Checklist
- view matrix equal
- projection matrix equal
- 3D covariance matrices are equal
- 3D gaussian coordinates are equal
- 2D projected gaussians ("p_proj") are correct
- In compute2d covariances:
    - J matrix is equal
    - blablabla
- 2D covariances are equal now
- max_spread (from the bboxes computation) is on par
- screenspace coordinates are the same
- bboxes are the same
- opacity is the same
- conic values are the same
- Still a problem on the filtering
- + the screen prints are done on a block level (i.e you don't do pixel by pixel)

TODO -> check the blending (specifically the gaussian density and the distance between pixel and center)
Looks like either the spread or blending is wrong

There was an underflow on the sigmas, but that doesn't explain the current look of the rasterization
Have to look into:
- ordering
- binning/chunking
- densities/alphas values


# Expected value for first 2 2D covariances
preproc[0] = [1.0728, -1.2140, 5.2402]
preproc[1] = [135.9209, 66.8127, 43.2185]
preproc[2] = [0.6305, 0.1136, 1.1046]
