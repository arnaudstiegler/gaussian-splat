# Checklist
- view matrix equal
- projection matrix equal
- 3D covariance matrices are equal
- 3D gaussian coordinates are equal
- 2D projected gaussians ("p_proj") are correct
- In compute2d covariances:
    - J matrix is equal
    - blablabla
- 2D covariances are equal now
- max_spread (from the bboxes computation) is on par
- screenspace coordinates are different (apparently because my height and width is twice the one from the repo)



# Expected value for first 2 2D covariances
preproc[0] = [1.0728, -1.2140, 5.2402]
preproc[1] = [135.9209, 66.8127, 43.2185]
preproc[2] = [0.6305, 0.1136, 1.1046]
